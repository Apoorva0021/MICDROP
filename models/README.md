Hey! this is one of those models that we used to test.


right no we are testing Vosk model:
Download the model from here:  
https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

Use this one: `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`

After downloading and extracting, just put the whole folder inside this `models` folder.

Final path should look like this: models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15

also you will have to install some python libraries here to run that code
like just give these commands in terminal
1) pip  install vosk
2) pip install sounddevice


Thatâ€™s it.
