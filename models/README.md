Hey! This folder is for all  models that we’re using in this STT project.


right no we are testing Vosk model:
Download the model from here:  
https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

Use this one: `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`

After downloading and extracting, just put the whole folder inside this `models` folder.

Final path should look like this: models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15

That’s it. 

I WILL ADD MORE HERE AS WE GO...
