HI!
Right now I am currently working on UI design and integration parts of our STT (speech to text) webapp...

RECENTS UPDATES:

-> Finalized the app name = VOICOVA

-> Finalized the app tagline = "Speak, we will write it down"

-> Designed and selected the official  app logo.

-> Created the initial web demo UI using streamlit...


Currently improving the design and exploring some additional features and options..


WILL KEEP UPDATING AS I COMPLETE THE NEXT STAGES :)
