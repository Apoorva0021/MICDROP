HI!
Right now I am currently working on UI design and integration parts of our STT (speech to text) webapp...

RECENTS UPDATES:

-> Finalized the app name = VOICOVA

-> Finalized the app tagline = "Speak, we will write it down"

-> Designed and selected the official  app logo.

Currently improving the design and exploring some additional features and options..

Hey!

I’ve made some great progress on the UI side of our Voicova speech-to-text web app. Since the last update, a lot of hands-on work has gone into improving how the app feels and works. Here's what's been done:

-> Finalized the visual identity: Selected and integrated the official app logo, and aligned it beside the app title and tagline for a cleaner header look.

-> Whisper (Small) model integrated: Users can now upload audio files in formats like .mp3, .wav, or .m4a, and the app will transcribe them using the Whisper model with solid accuracy.

-> Vosk (Live Speech) feature added: Live transcription using Vosk is now functional, and there's also a cool "Checklist Mode" where the app creates tasks/goals while you speak!

-> Sticky Notes UI Element (Top Goal of the Day): Added a cute sticky-note style feature where users can type in their top priority for the day. This gets highlighted and can even be reset. (I will make this voice controlled also)

-> Download Options: Users can now export the transcription results either as a .txt or .pdf file – pretty handy for notes, summaries, or saving ideas.

✨ Overall UI Polish: Streamlit interface improved for better layout spacing, contrast, responsiveness, and goal clarity.


Next up: I’ll be testing higher-accuracy Vosk models (1.8GB) and exploring more NLP features like summarization.


WILL KEEP UPDATING AS I COMPLETE THE NEXT STAGES :)
