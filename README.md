Project Title
On-Device Speech-to-text Models for Low-Latency Applications

Alloted Problem Statement:
In day-to-day student life, we often come across moments when we want to quickly record important thoughts, to-do lists, meeting takeaways, or lecture points. Typing everything instantly isn't always possible, especially during live discussions or when we're on the go.
Most speech-to-text systems today depend on internet-based APIs, which makes them less reliable in low-connectivity environments ‚Äî especially for students who may not always have stable access. There's also the concern of privacy when using cloud services to transcribe personal or academic content.

This project aims to build a simple, offline speech-to-text app that allows users to:
Record short lecture notes
Transcribe important points from group or club meetings
Create a spoken checklist for daily goals
Capture quick thoughts or reminders
The webapp will support English, Hindi, and mixed-language input, and will be built using lightweight open-source STT models like Whisper (Tiny/Base), Vosk, and potentially newer or alternate models like Coqui STT depending on feasibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Guidelines

- Each team must **fork this repository** before starting development.
- Rename your forked repository using your **official team name**.
- Update this README in the root of your repo and include: 
  - Team members' full names and emails  
  - The assigned problem statement (already allotted)
  - A quick start guide with examples to run your code
  - Any other details if we need to know
  
- Ensure **all code, documentation, and related work is committed to your forked repository**. 
- Make **regular commits** throughout the program. Your commit history will be considered during the evaluation to assess collaboration and progress.
- Each team is required to create an issue in the repository using the `aisoc-workspace` issue template. This issue must include the following details:

  - Team information  
  - Project title and problem statement  
  - Timeline with clear milestones  
  - Expected outcomes and deliverables  

All project-related discussions, updates, and queries must be conducted within this issue thread to ensure transparency and open collaboration across teams.

## Final Submission Guidelines

Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure successful completion and evaluation of your project:

1. **Working Demo**  
   - Before the final submission, you must include a working demo of your project.  
   - The demo should clearly explain the problem statement and how your solution addresses it.  
   - Upload your project to a shared location (e.g., Google Drive) and include the access link.

2. **Presentation Requirement**  
   - You are required to prepare a brief presentation detailing your solution.  
   - This presentation must be delivered **offline** to the evaluation panel.  
   - The presentation will be scheduled towards the end of July.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - Your final evaluation and the issuance of a certificate of completion will be based on:
     - Submission of a working demo with a clear explanation.
     - A shared drive link to your project.
     - A completed offline presentation to the panel.
   - Any changes or deviations from these requirements must be discussed and approved by the program staff.  
   - Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in termination of your contract.

Please ensure all deliverables are ready and submitted according to the above criteria.

## üìå Project Overview

Below are the projects allotted to different teams in AISoC 2025:

- **Project 1**: A chatbot system using advanced AI techniques to provide instant answers to university-related queries based on official web content.
- **Project 2**: A privacy-first mobile/web application that detects and identifies environmental sounds such as alarms and sirens in real time.
- **Project 3**: A surveillance system that monitors PPE compliance and detects unusual behavior by analyzing CCTV footage and walking patterns.
- **Project 4**: An indoor navigation tool leveraging BLE sensors to provide accurate, real-time location tracking within buildings.
- **Project 5**: A diagnostic solution that uses thermal imaging to track bacterial growth without physical contact or high-cost equipment.
- **Project 6**: A computer vision tool that detects and classifies vehicles at night, designed to improve traffic monitoring in low-light conditions.
- **Project 7**: A system to test and deploy fast, offline speech-to-text models that ensure privacy and responsiveness.
- **Project 8**: A backend framework that wraps existing project features into reusable, documented APIs to simplify integration and deployment.
- **Project 9**: A multi-factor attendance system combining face, voice, Bluetooth, and geolocation authentication with a focus on security.
- **Project 10**: A complete revamp of official university websites to enhance user experience, performance, and visual appeal.
- **Project 11**: A design-focused initiative encouraging teams to develop impactful user interfaces and design prototypes with a creative edge.
